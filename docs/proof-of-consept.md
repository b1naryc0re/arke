### Crypto Echanges Arbitrage strategy. Proof of concept.

#### Introduction
Proof of concept is done on two exchanges: kraken.com and quoinex.com. Both exchanges support [margin trading](https://www.investopedia.com/university/margin/ "margin trading").

#### Two principals of the arbitrage strategy:
1. The strategy is market-neutral: regardless of market fluctuation return isn’t impacted.
2. The strategy doesn’t incline to move funds between exchanges.

##### First principal is implemented via:
Issuing two hedging orders on two different exchanges.
1. Short selling on exchange with the higher market price.
2. Long buy on exchange with lower market price.

Whether markets go up or down loss on one order is hedged by the profit on another order.
We borrow (via margin trading) cryptocurrency from exchange/p2p for arbitrage. So we don't store crypto on accounts which impose market risks via market fluctuations.

##### Second principal is implemented via:
1. Having fiat balance on both exchanges.
2. After the arbitrage process ends (spread closes) we return initial margins to accounts in fiat by closing positions on exchanges. The balances change only for 'Profit and Loss' amounts.

#### Case 1. Market goes up.
